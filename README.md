# Document Database Service

## Overview

The Document Database Service is a microservice used to manage reviews, comments and accommodations facilities data within the **Booking** application. This service provides efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data using document database (MongoDB). The primary goal of this service is to ensure reliable storage of information and support the application’s business logic.

## Technologies
- Back-end: Java + Spring Boot
- Database: Document (MongoDB)

## Database Integration

In this project, I implemented a microservices architecture, allowing for seamless integration between the relational database and document database within the Booking application. This architecture enables each microservice to operate independently while still communicating effectively, which simplifies the integration of data across various components of the application.

## Getting Started

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the backend using Java and Spring Boot.
3. Configure the PostgreSQL database using pgAdmin.
4. Run the microservice.
